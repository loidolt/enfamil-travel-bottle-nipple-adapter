## General Info

Fed up with leaky bottle adapters available on Amazon, and not willing to use the disposable version provided by Enfamil themselves (sold separately to add insult to injury), I designed this simple adapter part.

Compared to the commercial versions it is much stiffer, has a tighter thread tolerance, and a shorter depth of threads to ensure the nipple seals well before the threads bottom out.

Say goodbye to leaks and wet onesies, you and your baby deserve better!

## Technologies

- Fusion 360

## Disclaimer

If printed and used properly, no formula or milk should come in contact with this part since the seal is provided between the nipple and the bottle only.

While I believe this to be a safe object to use I take no responsibility for anything that may happen to you or your kids while using this part. No warranty is given and no guarantee of safety is provided. By printing and using this part you take full responsibility for what may happen by exposing your child to 3D-printed plastic and any downstream repercussions.

## Print Settings

Use a food-safe plastic like PLA or PETG for safety, I recommend PETG so you don't have to worry about the temperature limits with PLA.

## Usage

Simply snap any Dr. Browns bottle nipple (or similar) into the cap and screw on onto the travel bottle. Ensure the nipple is fully seated into the cap to prevent leaks.
